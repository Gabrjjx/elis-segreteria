The second step of the authentication consists in obtaining the KeyId from our servers.
It's crucial to request and safely store this information, as you will need to use it for all the subsequent interactions with to our APIs.

To safely and correctly request the KeyId, please follow the information below.

Formatting the public_key field

ðŸš§
Make sure that the public_key is correctly formatted
Get the full content of your PEM public key previously generated.
Add the \n string between each line of your public key.
Collapse all the actual new line characters to bring the public key into a single line.

How the token field works

To generate a KeyId, you must provide an activation code in the token field.
Activation codes are disposable alphanumeric strings that are required for the authentication to our APIs.

You can obtain these activation codes in two ways: through your Satispay Business Account for the production environment or directly provided by us for the sandbox environment.

An example of an activation code is: 6N3ECU

Once you followed the aforementioned steps, you're ready to make a POST request to obtain your KeyId.

ðŸ“˜
Production VS Sandbox codes

Beware that all the activation codes generated from a production account will only work on production endpoints, while activation codes generated for the sandbox account will only work on sandbox endpoints.

The obtained KeyId must be saved in a safe place
