Starting

To keep Glitch fast for everyone, inactive projects go to sleep and wake up on request.


It looks like your project is taking an unusually long time to start up.
If your project runs its own server (e.g. express, fastify, etc) please
check to make sure that your code is not missing the instruction(s) to
start the server.
