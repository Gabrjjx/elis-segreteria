The following guide explains how to create payments with the provided Satispay API.

Depending on the selected flow, payments experience different lifecycles.

* * *

# Payment lifecycle   [Skip link to Payment lifecycle](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#payment-lifecycle)

### [`MATCH_CODE`](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/one-off), [`MATCH_USER`](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/payment-mobile-number)   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#match_code-match_user)

These type of payments always begins in `PENDING` status.

They can transition to:

- `ACCEPTED` if:

  - the consumer accepts the payment via the Satispay App.
- `CANCELED` if:

  - the payment expires.
  - the user explicitly cancels the payment via the Satispay App.

`ACCEPTED` and `CANCELED` are final statuses which cannot be changed.

### [`PRE_AUTHORIZED`](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/automatic-payments), [`HOTP_AUTH`](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/one-off-hotp)   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#pre_authorized-hotp_auth)

For this payment types, the payment will be created in `ACCEPTED` status.

There are no transitional states, as if the charge on the user's wallet fails, the payment won't be generated, and you will receive a `4xx` status code.

* * *

### [`FUND_LOCK`](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/funds-lock-late-capture)   [Skip link to [object Object]](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#fund_lock)

This type of payment always begins in `PENDING` status.

It can transition from `PENDING` to:

- `AUTHORIZED` if:

  - the consumer authorizes the fund lock payment via the Satispay App.
- `CANCELED` if:

  - the user explicitly cancels the payment via the Satispay App.
  - the payment expires.

Once the payment status is in `AUTHORIZED`, it can transition to:

- `ACCEPTED` if:

  - the merchant accepts it via an `ACCEPT` action using the [Update payment API](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/update-a-payment).
- `CANCELED` if:

  - the merchant cancels it via a `CANCEL` action using the [Update payment API](https://developers.satispay.com/docs/update-a-payment).

# Refunds   [Skip link to Refunds](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#refunds)

Refunds can only be processed via our API.

To perform refunds you need to create a new payment with the `REFUND` flow.

You will need to send the `parent_payment_uid` with the payment id that you want to refund and the `amount_unit` that you want to refund for that specific payment.

We suggest you to fill the `external_code` with your internal order id, in order to better reconcile refunds in your payment reports.

This field will also be shown to the user via the Satispay app.

Refund can only be created in `ACCEPTED` status.

There are no transitional states, as if the refund fails, the refund won't be generated, and you will receive a `4xx` status code.

If the refund goes well, you can distinguish the refund payment by using the response `type` property, which will be `REFUND_TO_BUSINESS`.

* * *

### Refunds for payments with only e-money   [Skip link to Refunds for payments with only e-money](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-a-payment\#refunds-for-payments-with-only-e-money)

Refunds are only possible within `365` days from the payment creation date.

It is possible to create multiple partial refunds until you reach the total amount of the payment that you want to refund.

Refunds are only possible on the same day of payment creation and for the total amount of the payment.
