Our authentication relies on the principles outlined in the [Signing HTTP Messages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-10) draft, which is part of the Web Payments initiative.

To initiate the authentication process for your implementation, begin with the first two steps.

These steps are a one-time requirement, as the keys generated can be used for all future calls to our APIs.

1. [Generate a pair of **RSA keys**](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/generate-rsa-keys)
2. [Obtain the **KeyId** using the dedicated API](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/keyid)

The following steps, on the other hand, should be performed with each request and are essential for the API to function correctly.

Additionally, in each step, we have included code samples for the most common implementations.

3. [Create the **Digest** of the body](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-the-digest)
4. [Create the **Message** to be signed](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/create-the-string)
5. [Create the **Signature**](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/sign-the-string)
6. [Compose the **authentication header**](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/compose-the-authentication-header)

Once you've completed all the aforementioned steps, both the one-time ones and the per-request ones, you should be able to check your authentication by performing the [test request](https://developers.satispay.com/reference/testinput).
