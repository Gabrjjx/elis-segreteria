umUp REST API

SumUpâ€™s REST API operates with JSON HTTP requests and responses. The request bodies are sent through resource-oriented URLs and use the standard HTTP response codes.
You can experiment and work on your integration in a sandbox that doesn't affect your regular data and doesn't process real transactions. To create a sandbox merchant account visit the dashboard. To use the sandbox when interacting with SumUp APIs create an API key and use it for authentication.
